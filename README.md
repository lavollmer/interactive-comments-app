## Overview
Frontend Mentor provided local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

Your users should be able to:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
- Build this project as a full-stack application

## My Process

I began my project by downloading all the necessary assets from the design folder. After this, I installed Vite, ReactJS and TailwindCSS for the project. Finally, I updated the Tailwind config js file with all the design color assets and Google Font "rubik". 

My project involved many different moving pieces; therefore, I thought it was appropriate to review the design to determine how to approach the project. I used my Notepad to write out the various aspects of the project from functionality, buttons, design, and reusable components. Based on these factors, I started my creating a generic comment card which would be reusable for numerous aspects of the project. The comment card included the avatar image, user's name, timing since published, reply button, comment section and a styled increment decrement button. 

After finishing the reusable comment card, I decided to work on the User Comment section to style it.
