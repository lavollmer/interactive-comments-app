## Overview
Frontend Mentor provided local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

Your users should be able to:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
- Build this project as a full-stack application
